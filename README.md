# Housing-Model-Predictor

This project is designed to build a predictive regression model on predicting median housing prices for individual states within California. 

The data can be found on Kaggle and this project will be updated shortly. 

Final outcome is to host the solution on an open source web server for the model to run or streamlit/django/flask etc.

This project is based on the sci-kit learn and tensorflow course from A.Geron
