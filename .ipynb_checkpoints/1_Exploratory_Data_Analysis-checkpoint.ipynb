    "# Prediciting Median Housing Prices in California\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of **predicting the median house price in any district of California**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick breakdown of what the task is: \n",
    "1. Supervised learning task \n",
    "2. Typical Regression model (predicting a numerical output - median housing price) \n",
    "3. Multiple regression model as it uses multiple features \n",
    "4. Univariate regression porblem as we are predicting a single value for each district. \n",
    "5. Batch Learning problem as the data is only this data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take the following approach: \n",
    "1. Problem defintiion\n",
    "2. Data \n",
    "3. Evaluation \n",
    "4. Features \n",
    "5. Modelling \n",
    "6. Experimentation \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement, \n",
    "> Given a house located in a district in California can we predict what the median price will be, given all other metrics? \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from the StatLib Repository website - also on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation \n",
    "\n",
    "We are choosing the Root Mean Square Error as our performance measure (RMSE) - which tell sus how much error the model makes during a prediction - with a heigher wieght for large errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can get the lowest possible RMSE then we have a decent enough model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features \n",
    "\n",
    "**Create data dictionary** \n",
    "\n",
    "### Heart Disease Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "A data dictionary describes the data you're dealing with. Not all datasets come with them so this is where you may have to do your research or ask a **subject matter expert** (someone who knows about the data) for more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the features we'll use to predict our target variable (heart disease or no heart disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. age - age in years \n",
    "2. sex - (1 = male; 0 = female) \n",
    "3. cp - chest pain type \n",
    "    * 0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart\n",
    "    * 1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart\n",
    "    * 2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)\n",
    "    * 3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease\n",
    "4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "    * anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern\n",
    "5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl \n",
    "    * serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides\n",
    "    * above 200 is cause for concern\n",
    "6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) \n",
    "    * '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes\n",
    "7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "    * 0: Nothing to note\n",
    "    * 1: ST-T Wave abnormality\n",
    "        - can range from mild symptoms to severe problems\n",
    "        - signals non-normal heart beat\n",
    "    * 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy\n",
    "        - Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber\n",
    "8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved \n",
    "9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) \n",
    "10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest \n",
    "    * looks at stress of heart during excercise\n",
    "    * unhealthy heart will stress more\n",
    "11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "    * 0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)\n",
    "    * 1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)\n",
    "    * 2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart\n",
    "12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy \n",
    "    * colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through\n",
    "    * the more blood movement the better (no clots)\n",
    "13. thal - thalium stress result\n",
    "    * 1,3: normal\n",
    "    * 6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now\n",
    "    * 7: reversable defect: no proper blood movement when excercising \n",
    "14. target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no) (= the predicted attribute)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** No personal identifiable information (PPI) can be found in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to save these to a Python dictionary or in an external file, so we can look at them later without coming back here.\n",
